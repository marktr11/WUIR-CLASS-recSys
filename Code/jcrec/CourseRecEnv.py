    This class implements a Gymnasium environment for course recommendations using
    reinforcement learning. The environment simulates the process of recommending
    courses to learners to help them acquire skills needed for jobs.

    1. Baseline: Uses number of applicable jobs as reward
    2. Skip-expertise: Uses a utility function that considers both skill acquisition
       and job applicability

        - Discrete space of size nb_courses
        - Each action represents recommending a specific course
